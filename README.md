#Projects in Progress 

A repository for some of my early machine learning projects - completed with the goal of gaining experience and insight into various models and technigues in order to help with common business challenges such as customer churn prediction and purchase forecasting. Projects include classification and regression problems using XGBoost, LLMs like BERT, and other models including DecisionTrees, and linear and logistic regression.
